# CHSH-Game-Tutorial
I developed a brief tutorial that demonstrates the strangeness and advantage of playing quantum games over their classical counterparts.
This course is intended for beginners and those with little prior knowledge of quantum information and computation. Readers may choose to check the references listed at the conclusion of the file for a more in-depth grasp of the subject matter. <br>
Comments and constructive criticism are encouraged :)
